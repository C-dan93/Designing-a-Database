# Database Design Portfolio

A comprehensive collection of database schemas and implementations across different database paradigms and use cases.

## üìã Overview

This repository showcases various database design approaches, from traditional relational models to modern NoSQL solutions. Each project demonstrates practical database concepts, normalization principles, and real-world application scenarios.

## üóÑÔ∏è Current Projects

### University Student Management System (SQL)
- **Type:** Relational Database
- **Technology:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)
- **Features:** 
  - Normalized schema design
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Data validation constraints
  - Course prerequisites system
- **Use Case:** Academic institution data management

### E-commerce Platform (Multi-paradigm)
- **Relational Model (SQL):** Traditional normalized approach with Customer, Product, and Orders tables
- **Document Model (MongoDB):** Flexible JSON-based structure for evolving requirements
- **Comparison:** Demonstrates trade-offs between consistency and flexibility

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This repository serves as a practical exploration of:
- **Database Design Principles:** Normalization, relationships, constraints
- **Schema Evolution:** Adapting structures as requirements change
- **Technology Comparison:** SQL vs NoSQL trade-offs
- **Real-world Applications:** Solving actual business problems with data

## üöÄ Future Additions

Planning to expand with:
- Graph databases (Neo4j) for social networks
- Time-series databases for IoT/analytics
- Key-value stores for caching scenarios
- Distributed database designs
- Performance optimization examples

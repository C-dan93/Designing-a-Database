# Designing-a-Database
This repository contains SQL script for creating a relational and non relational databases.

This repository contains an SQL script that creates a basic schema for an e-commerce platform. The schema includes three tables:

Customer: Stores customer information, including their ID, name, email, password, state, and address.

Product: Stores product details, such as ID, name, description, price, rating, image URL, material, capacity, and color.

Orders: Records order information, including order ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, order date, total amount, and shipping information.

The Orders table establishes relationships with the Customer and Product tables through foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient querying of customer orders and product sales.
